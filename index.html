	<h2> About me.	</h2> 
	<p>
		<em>Note: during the Fall 2021 semester I am at the Institute for Advanced Study as a visiting member, on leave from USC.</em> As of September 2020, I'm an assistant professor in the mathematics department at the University of Southern California. Previously, I was a Ritt Assisant Professor in the mathematics department at Columbia University. Before that I was an NSF postdoctoral research fellow and pure mathematics instructor at Columbia during 2017-2019 and at MIT during 2016-2017. 
	</p>

	<h2> Research interests.	</h2> 
	<p>
		I work in symplectic geometry, a branch of mathematics lying somewhere at the intersection of smooth topology, differential geometry, algebraic geometry, and mathematical physics.
		I like to study the complicated algebraic gadgets arising in Floer theory and symplectic field theory and apply them to classification problems in symplectic geometry or try to say new things about Hamiltonian dynamical systems.
		These invariants also have some rather intruiging connections to things like string theory and algebraic geometry, which means there are lots of surprises in store.

In the special case of four-dimensional ellipsoids, we apply homological perturbation theory to the associated filtered L-infinity algebras and we prove that the resulting structure coefficients count punctured pseudoholomorphic curves in cobordisms between ellipsoids.

		We construct invariants of any semipositive symplectic manifold which count rational curves satisfying multibranched tangency constraints to a local divisor. We also construct analogous invariants counting punctured curves with negative ends on a small skinny ellipsoid, and we prove that these counts coincide at least in dimension four. We then give a formula describing how tangency constraints arise as point constraints are pushed together, and we use this to recursively compute all invariants in dimension four in terms of Gromov-Witten invariants of blowups.

		The third named author has been developing a theory of “higher” symplectic capacities. These capacities are invariant under taking products, and so are well-suited for studying the stabilized embedding problem. The aim of this note is to apply this theory, assuming its expected properties, to solve the stabilized embedding problem for integral ellipsoids, when the eccentricity of the domain is the opposite parity of the eccentricity of the target and the target is not a ball. For the other parity, the embedding we construct is definitely not always optimal; also, in the ball case, our methods recover previous results of McDuff, and of the second named author and Kerman. There is a similar story, with no condition on the eccentricity of the target, when the target is a polydisc: a special case of this implies a conjecture of the first named author, Frenkel, and Schlenk concerning the rescaled polydisc limit function. Some related aspects of the stabilized embedding problem and some open questions are also discussed.

We present the cubic lattice stick index of various knots and links, including all (p, p + 1)-torus knots, and show how composing and taking satellites can be used to obtain the cubic lattice stick index for a relatively large infinite class of knots. We present several bounds relating cubic lattice stick index to other known invariants. Finally, we define and consider lattice torsion index.

		We present a computer algorithm which confirms that an approximately discete subgroup of PSL(2,C) is in fact discrete. The algorithm proceeds by constructing the Dirichlet domain of the subgroup in H<sup>3</sup> , and then checks that the hypotheses of Poincares Theorem for Fundametal Polyhedra are satisfied. In order to check that the hypotheses are exactly satisfied, we rely on group theoretical properties resulting from certain geometric conditions of the Dirichlet domain. We begin in Section 1 with a review of relevant background material. In Section 2 we provide a formal statement of the problem, including the restrictions we impose upon the subgroup of PSL(2,C). In Section 3 we introduce the geometric conditions which must apply for our algorithm to hold, and we prove that these are generically satisfied. We then show in Section 4 that these conditions are in fact sufficient to verify the hypotheses of Poincare's Theorem. In Section 5 we look at the field containing our matrix entries.

	In these videos, we use computer optimization techniques to find a Hamiltonian flow which squeezes the four-dimensional ellipsoid E(1,5) into the four-ball of smallest possible area. Using pseudoholomorphic curve invariants, one can prove that the smallest possible ball has area 5/2. The numerical embedding found here is close to the theoretical optimal. The left video depicts (in the moment map projection) the final flow as a function of training time. The center video depicts the best Hamiltonian flow found in the moment map projection, while the right video is a 3D projection. See <a href="Squeeze.zip">here</a> for some code (in Tensorflow).

		As metagenomic projects gather large quantities of genomic data from novel microbial species, there is a great need for improved computational tools to sort and understand such data. An important part is the ``binning problem'', namely to determine the number of species present in a sample and to sort DNA fragments by species of origin.

		We present PuzzleCluster, a new clustering algorithm for unsupervised binning in metagenomics. Besides implementing a new clustering approach, PuzzleCluster introduces several other new features, such as using word agreement information for increased clustering accuracy, and estimating clustering parameters by fitting data with the expectation maximization algorithm. PuzzleCluster uses no prior assumptions about the genetic makeup or number of species present. Our tests show that PuzzleCluster frequently outperforms the best existing unsupervised binning programs.
