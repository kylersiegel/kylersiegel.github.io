	<h2> About me.	</h2> 
	<p>
		I'm an assistant professor in the mathematics department at the University of Southern California. Previously, I was a Ritt Assisant Professor in the mathematics department at Columbia University, and an NSF postdoctoral research fellow and pure mathematics instructor at Columbia during 2017-2019 and at MIT during 2016-2017. During Fall 2021 I was a member at the Institute for Advanced Study. My work is partially supported by NSF grant DMS-2105578.
	</p>

	<h2> Research interests.	</h2> 
	<p>
		My background is mostly in symplectic geometry, a branch of mathematics lying somewhere at the intersection of smooth topology, differential geometry, algebraic geometry, and mathematical physics, with some input from string theory.
		I like to study the complicated algebraic structures arising from pseudoholomorphic curve invariants such as Floer theory and symplectic field theory, which are defined by counting maps from Riemann surfaces into a target space subject to a certain elliptic PDE. 
		At the moment I am particularly interested in interactions between quantitative symplectic geometry (e.g. Hamiltonian flows in Euclidean space) and complex algebraic geometry (e.g. singular algebraic curves).

		We construct a large new family of rational algebraic curves in the complex projective plane with a $(p,q)$ cusp singularity. More precisely, we classify all such pairs $(p,q)$ for curves which are rigid (in a suitable sense), finding a phase transition from discrete to continuous as the ratio $p/q$ crosses the fourth power of the golden ratio.
		In particular, for many values of $(p,q)$, our curves solve the minimal degree problem for plane curves with a $(p,q)$ cusp singularity.
		Our technique relies on (i) explicit bijections between curves in log Calabi-Yau surfaces and curves in nontoric blowups of toric surfaces, (ii) the tropical vertex group and its connections with relative Gromov--Witten invariants, and (iii) recent positivity results for scattering diagrams.  
		As our main application, we completely solve the stabilized symplectic embedding problem for 
		four-dimensional ellipsoids into the four-dimensional round ball. 
		The answer is neatly encoded in a single piecewise smooth function which transitions from an infinite Fibonacci staircase to an explicit rational function. 
		Many of our results also extend to other target spaces, e.g. del Pezzo surfaces and more general rational surfaces.

We show that the infinite staircases which arise in the ellipsoid embedding functions of rigid del Pezzo surfaces can be entirely explained in terms of rational sesquicuspidal symplectic curves. Moreover, we show that these curves can all be realized algebraically, giving various new families of algebraic curves with one cusp singularity. Our main techniques are (i) a generalized Orevkov twist, and (ii) the interplay between algebraic $\mathbb{Q}$-Gorenstein smoothings and symplectic almost toric fibrations. Along the way we develop various methods for constructing singular algebraic (and 
hence symplectic) curves which may be of independent interest.

Let $B^{2n}(R)$ denote the closed $2n$-dimensional symplectic ball of area $R$,
and let $\Sigma_g(L)$ be a closed symplectic surface of genus $g$ and area $L$.
We prove that there is a symplectic embedding $\bigsqcup\limits_{i=1}^k B^4(R_i) \times \Sigma_g (L) \hookrightarrow \operatorname{int}(B^4(R))\times \Sigma_g (L)$ if and only if there exists a symplectic embedding $\bigsqcup\limits_{i=1}^k B^4(R_i) \hookrightarrow \operatorname{int}(B^4(R))$. 

This lies in contrast with the standard higher dimensional ball packing problem $\bigsqcup\limits_{i=1}^k B^{2n}(R_i) \hookrightarrow \operatorname{int}(B^{2n}(R))$ for $n >2$, which we conjecture (based on index behavior for pseudoholomorphic curves) is controlled entirely by Gromov's two ball theorem and volume considerations.
We also deduce analogous results for stabilized embeddings of concave toric domains into convex domains, and we establish a stabilized version of Gromov's two ball theorem which holds in any dimension.
Our main tools are: (i) the symplectic blowup construction along symplectic submanifolds, (ii) an h-principle for symplectic surfaces in high dimensional symplectic manifolds, and (iii) a stabilization result for pseudoholomorphic curves of genus zero.

	Given a closed symplectic manifold, we construct invariants which count (a) closed rational pseudoholomorphic curves with prescribed cusp singularities and (b) punctured rational pseudoholomorphic curves with ellipsoidal negative ends.
	We prove an explicit equivalence between these two frameworks, which in particular gives a new geometric interpretation of various counts in symplectic field theory.
	We show that these invariants encode important information about singular symplectic curves and stable symplectic embedding obstructions. We also prove a correspondence theorem between rigid unicuspidal curves and perfect exceptional classes, which we illustrate by classifying rigid unicuspidal (symplectic or algebraic) curves in the first Hirzebruch surface.

		The third named author has been developing a theory of âhigherâ symplectic capacities. These capacities are invariant under taking products, and so are well-suited for studying the stabilized embedding problem. The aim of this note is to apply this theory, assuming its expected properties, to solve the stabilized embedding problem for integral ellipsoids, when the eccentricity of the domain is the opposite parity of the eccentricity of the target and the target is not a ball. For the other parity, the embedding we construct is definitely not always optimal; also, in the ball case, our methods recover previous results of McDuff, and of the second named author and Kerman. There is a similar story, with no condition on the eccentricity of the target, when the target is a polydisc: a special case of this implies a conjecture of the first named author, Frenkel, and Schlenk concerning the rescaled polydisc limit function. Some related aspects of the stabilized embedding problem and some open questions are also discussed.

		We present a computer algorithm which confirms that an approximately discete subgroup of PSL(2,C) is in fact discrete. The algorithm proceeds by constructing the Dirichlet domain of the subgroup in H<sup>3</sup> , and then checks that the hypotheses of Poincares Theorem for Fundametal Polyhedra are satisfied. In order to check that the hypotheses are exactly satisfied, we rely on group theoretical properties resulting from certain geometric conditions of the Dirichlet domain. We begin in Section 1 with a review of relevant background material. In Section 2 we provide a formal statement of the problem, including the restrictions we impose upon the subgroup of PSL(2,C). In Section 3 we introduce the geometric conditions which must apply for our algorithm to hold, and we prove that these are generically satisfied. We then show in Section 4 that these conditions are in fact sufficient to verify the hypotheses of Poincare's Theorem. In Section 5 we look at the field containing our matrix entries.

		As metagenomic projects gather large quantities of genomic data from novel microbial species, there is a great need for improved computational tools to sort and understand such data. An important part is the ``binning problem'', namely to determine the number of species present in a sample and to sort DNA fragments by species of origin.

		We present PuzzleCluster, a new clustering algorithm for unsupervised binning in metagenomics. Besides implementing a new clustering approach, PuzzleCluster introduces several other new features, such as using word agreement information for increased clustering accuracy, and estimating clustering parameters by fitting data with the expectation maximization algorithm. PuzzleCluster uses no prior assumptions about the genetic makeup or number of species present. Our tests show that PuzzleCluster frequently outperforms the best existing unsupervised binning programs.
